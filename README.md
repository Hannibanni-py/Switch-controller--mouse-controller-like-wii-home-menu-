With this code you can control your mouse with the motion sensors of the "JoyCon".

Just connect your right "JoyCon" via bluetooth.

THIS DOESNT WORK WITH THE "PRO CONTROLLER"

Note that you have to install the "pyautogui" lib  and the "pyjoycon" lib to make the code work.

Here are the commands to install them:

pip install pyautogui

pip install joycon-python hidapi pyglm
